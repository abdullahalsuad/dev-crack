# Node.js Interview Questions - Basic Level

---

### 1. What is **Event Loop** in Node.js?

> The Event Loop is like a traffic policeman that never sleeps. It handles all asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread. It constantly checks if any async task is finished, and then executes its callback.

### 2. What is a **Stream**?

> A Stream is like a water pipe for data. It allows processing data in chunks instead of loading the whole file into memory—great for large files.

### 3. What is a **Buffer**?

> Buffer is temporary storage for raw binary data. It stores file or network data before processing. Useful for handling binary efficiently.

### 4. What is **EventEmitter**?

> EventEmitter is like a radio station that broadcasts events. Other parts of your code can listen to these broadcasts and respond. It's the foundation for many Node.js features.

### 5. What is a **Router** in Express?

> Routers help organize related routes into separate files. For example, user routes and product routes can live in different modules.

### 6. What is **Middleware** in Express?

> Middleware functions are like checkpoints. Each HTTP request passes through them before reaching the final route. They can modify the request, response, or end the cycle.

### 7. Purpose of `next()` in Express?

> `next()` moves the request to the next middleware or route handler. Without it, the request gets stuck.

### 8. Difference between `req.params` and `req.query`?

- `req.params` comes from the URL path (e.g., `/user/:id`)
- `req.query` comes from query strings (e.g., `?search=john`)

### 9. What is the Global Object in Node.js?

> The global object in Node.js is `global`. It provides global variables and functions like `setTimeout`, `console`, and `process`. Unlike browsers, Node.js doesn't use `window`.

### 10. What is the role of the package.json file?

> `package.json` holds metadata about the project like name, version, dependencies, scripts, and more. It's essential for managing a Node.js project.

### 11. What are CommonJS modules?

> CommonJS is the module system used in Node.js. It uses `require()` and `module.exports` to import/export code between files.

### 12. What is a callback function in Node.js?

> A callback is a function passed to another function to be called when a task completes. It's a way to handle async code.

### 13. What is a REPL in Node.js?

> REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It's an interactive shell to execute Node.js code and see results immediately.

### 14. What is the purpose of the **dirname and **filename variables?

- `__dirname` gives the directory of the current file.
- `__filename` gives the full path of the current file.

### 15. Difference between `readFile` and `createReadStream`?

- `readFile`: Loads the entire file into memory.
- `createReadStream`: Reads the file in small chunks—better for large files.

### 16. Difference between `app.use()` and `app.all()`?

- `app.use()`: Applies to **all** HTTP methods and paths.
- `app.all()`: Applies to **all** HTTP methods but only **specific** paths.

### 17. What is **Error-handling Middleware**?

> It catches errors in middleware or routes. It uses four arguments: `(err, req, res, next)` and is used as a fallback to handle problems.

### 18. What is **Helmet Middleware**?

> Helmet adds secure HTTP headers to protect against attacks like XSS and clickjacking. It hides Express-specific details from attackers.

### 19. What is **Rate Limiting**?

> It limits how many requests a user can make in a given time. Prevents abuse and server overload (e.g., 100 requests/hour).

### 20. What is **CORS**?

> CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) controls which domains can access your API. Prevents unauthorized requests from other domains.

### 21. Session vs **JWT Authentication**?

- **Sessions**: Store user data on the server.
- **JWT**: Store encrypted user data in a client-side token.  
  JWT is stateless and does not require server storage.

### 22. Purpose of the **dotenv Package**?

> Loads environment variables from a `.env` file. Useful for storing secrets like DB passwords or API keys.

### 23. Difference between **Synchronous** and **Asynchronous**?

- **Synchronous**: Blocks execution until the current task finishes.
- **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking; tasks run in the background.

### 24. What is `Promise.all()`?

> Executes multiple promises in parallel and waits for all to finish. Returns an array of results.

### 25. What is `async/await`?

> It makes asynchronous code look synchronous. `await` waits for a promise to resolve inside an `async` function.
