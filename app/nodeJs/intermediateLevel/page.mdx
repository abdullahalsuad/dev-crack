# Node.js Interview Questions - Intermediate Level

---

### 1. Difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?

> - process.nextTick() runs before the next event loop iteration.
> - setImmediate() runs in the next event loop iteration.
> - nextTick has higher priority and is faster.


### 2. Purpose of the Cluster Module?

> The Cluster module allows you to create multiple worker processes to utilize all CPU cores. One master distributes work to workers, improving performance.


### 3. Difference between require() and import?

> - require(): CommonJS, synchronous.
> - import: ES6 module, asynchronous.  
>   Requires `"type": "module"` in package.json.


### 4. What is Clustering?

> Runs multiple Node.js processes to use all CPU cores. Improves performance for heavy or CPU-bound tasks.


### 5. Purpose of package-lock.json?

> Locks exact versions of dependencies for consistent installs across environments.


### 6. Difference: dependencies vs devDependencies?

> - dependencies: Needed for app to run.
> - devDependencies: Only needed during development (e.g., testing tools).


### 7. What are NPM Scripts?

> Scripts defined in package.json to run tasks like testing, building, starting the server, etc. Example: `npm start`.


### 8. Purpose of nodemon?

> Automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected. Great for development.


### 9. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous exceptions?

> - Synchronous exceptions can be caught using `try/catch`.
> - Asynchronous exceptions (e.g., in callbacks or Promises) must be handled with `.catch()` or error callbacks.


### 10. What is callback hell and how to avoid it?

> Callback hell happens when multiple nested callbacks make code hard to read. Avoid it using Promises or `async/await`.


### 11. What are the phases of the Node.js Event Loop?

> The phases are: Timers, Pending Callbacks, Idle/Prepare, Poll, Check (setImmediate), Close Callbacks. Each phase handles different kinds of tasks.


### 12. What is the role of the `process` object?

> The `process` object provides information and control over the current Node.js process, like environment variables, arguments, and exit codes.


### 13. How can you handle uncaught exceptions in Node.js?

> Use `process.on('uncaughtException', callback)` to catch unexpected errors. However, it's better to avoid relying on it for stability.


### 14. What is the use of process.env?

> `process.env` allows access to environment variables. Useful for managing configurations like database URLs or secret keys.


### 15. What are child processes in Node.js?

> Child processes allow you to run shell commands or separate Node.js processes using the `child_process` module (`spawn`, `exec`, `fork`).


### 16. What is the purpose of the `os` module?

> The `os` module provides information about the operating system, like memory, CPU, and network interfaces.


### 17. What are ticks and microtasks in Node.js?

> - Ticks are processed after the current operation using `process.nextTick()`.
> - Microtasks include Promise callbacks, processed after each phase before the next task.


### 18. What is the use of the `util` module in Node.js?

> The `util` module provides utility functions like `util.promisify()` and `util.inherits()` to help with debugging and inheritance.


### 19. How does Node.js handle file uploads?

> File uploads in Node.js are handled using middleware like `multer` that processes `multipart/form-data` requests.


### 20. What is a throttle and debounce function?

> - **Throttle** limits how often a function can run.
> - **Debounce** delays function execution until no calls have occurred for a specific time.


### 21. What are HTTP status codes?

> HTTP status codes indicate the result of HTTP requests (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Server Error`).


### 22. What is meant by a stateless server?

> A stateless server does not store any user session data. Each request is processed independently.


### 23. What is middleware chaining in Express?

> Middleware chaining means multiple middleware functions run in order. Each calls `next()` to move to the next.


### 24. How to serve static files in Express?

> `app.use(express.static('public'))`  
> Use `express.static()` to serve static files like images, CSS, JS from a folder.


### 25. What are template engines in Node.js?

> Template engines like **EJS**, **Pug**, or **Handlebars** allow you to generate dynamic HTML content from server-side data.
