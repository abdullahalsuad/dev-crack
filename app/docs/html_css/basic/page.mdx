```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 12. What are HTML Entities?

In HTML, some characters are **reserved** (like `<`, `>`, `/`, `&`) and cannot be used directly because they conflict with the syntax of the language.

To display these characters on a webpage, we use **HTML Entities**.

### Common Examples:

| Character            | Entity Name | Entity Number |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `<` (less than)      | `&lt;`      | `&#60;`         |
| `>` (greater than)   | `&gt;`      | `&#62;`         |
| `&` (ampersand)      | `&amp;`     | `&#38;`         |
| (non-breaking space) | `&nbsp;`    | `&#160;`        |

### Example:

```html
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;PM</p>
```

## 13. What are HTML Tags?

**HTML tags** are the building blocks of an HTML document. They define the structure and content of web pages.

Each HTML tag usually comes in a **pair**:

- **Opening tag:** `<tagname>`
- **Closing tag:** `</tagname>`

### Example:

```html
<p>Hello, world!</p>
```

## 14. What is a `<marquee>` in HTML?

The `<marquee>` tag in HTML is used to create **scrolling text or images** on a webpage — either horizontally or vertically.

### Key Features:

- Scrolls content automatically.
- Can control speed, direction, and behavior.
- Not part of modern HTML standards and is **deprecated** in HTML5.

### Example:

```html
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left">This is a scrolling message</marquee>
```
## 15. What is the advantage of collapsing white space?

**Collapsing white space** means that the browser treats multiple spaces, tabs, and newlines as a **single space** when rendering HTML content.

### Advantages:

- **Cleaner output**: Prevents extra spacing from affecting layout unintentionally.
- **Improved readability**: Developers can format HTML code with proper indentation without impacting display.
- **Smaller file size**: Extra spaces and line breaks aren’t rendered, which helps optimize performance.
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform text display across different browsers and screen sizes.

### Example:

```html
<p>This       is        text.</p>
```

## 16. How do you insert a copyright symbol in HTML?

In HTML, you can insert a **copyright symbol** using an **HTML entity**.

### Methods:

- **Entity name:** `&copy;`
- **Entity number:** `&#169;`

### Example:

```html
<p>&copy; 2025 Your Company</p>
```
