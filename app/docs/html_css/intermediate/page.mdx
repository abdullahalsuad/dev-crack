## 1. What is the difference between `id` and `class` attributes?

- `id`: unique identifier for one element.
- `class`: can be shared across multiple elements.

```html
<div id="header">Unique Header</div>
<div class="box">Reusable Box 1</div>
<div class="box">Reusable Box 2</div>
```

## 2. What is the purpose of the `label` element in forms?

It improves accessibility and connects a text label to an input field using the `for` attribute.

```html
<label for="email">Email:</label> <input id="email" type="email" name="email" />
```

Clicking the label will focus the associated input.

## 3. What is the difference between `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block` elements?

- **Block**: takes full width (e.g., `<div>`)
- **Inline**: flows with text, no width/height (e.g., `<span>`)
- **Inline-block**: behaves like inline but allows width/height

```html
<span>Inline</span>
<div>Block</div>
```

## 4. How do you create a dropdown menu in HTML?

Use the `<select>` and `<option>` tags.

```html
<label for="city">Choose a city:</label>
<select id="city" name="city">
  <option value="dhaka">Dhaka</option>
  <option value="chattogram">Chattogram</option>
</select>
```

## 5. What are self-closing tags in HTML?

Tags that don't need a closing tag (HTML5 allows omitting `/` but XHTML requires it).

Examples: `<img>`, `<input>`, `<br>`, `<hr>`

```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" />
<br />
<hr />
```

## 6. What is the use of the `fieldset` and `legend` tags?

Used to group related form elements together for better organization and accessibility.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Personal Info</legend>
  <label>Name: <input type="text" /></label>
</fieldset>
```

## 7. What is the difference between `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<div>`?

- `<section>`: thematic grouping of content
- `<article>`: independent, reusable content
- `<div>`: generic container with no meaning

```html
<section>
  <h2>Services</h2>
</section>

<article>
  <h2>Blog Post</h2>
  <p>This is a post...</p>
</article>
```

## 8. How can you embed a video or audio file in HTML?

Use `<video>` and `<audio>` with `controls` attribute.

```html
<video controls width="320">
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<audio controls>
  <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
</audio>
```

## 9. What are `data-*` attributes used for?

They store extra data on elements without affecting the layout or performance. Often used with JavaScript.

```html
<div data-user-id="123" data-role="admin">User Info</div>
```

```js
const div = document.querySelector("div");
console.log(div.dataset.userId); // "123"
```

## 10. What is the difference between `<script>` placement in `<head>` vs `<body>`?

- **In `<head>`**: Blocks rendering until script loads (unless `async`/`defer` used).
- **In `<body>` (bottom)**: Ensures HTML loads before script executes.

✅ Best practice:

```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

## 11. What is the significance of `<head>` and `<body>` tag in HTML?

The `<head>` tag provides information about the document. It is always enclosed within the `<html>` tag and contains **metadata** about the webpage.

Some of the commonly used elements inside `<head>` include:

- `<title>`
- `<meta>`
- `<link>`
- `<style>`
- `<script>`

These elements define things like page title, character encoding, linked CSS files, and other resources.

The `<body>` tag, on the other hand, contains **all the visible content** of the web page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, buttons, and more. It's what users see and interact with in their browser.

- `<h1> - <h6>`
- `<p>`
- `<img>`
- `<link>`
- `<button>`

## 12. Difference between `<strong>`, `<b>` and `<em>`, `<i>` tags

- `<b>` and `<i>` are **styling-only** tags.

  - `<b>`: Makes text bold.
  - `<i>`: Makes text italic.
  - ❌ These do **not** carry any semantic meaning.

- `<strong>` and `<em>` add **semantic meaning**:
  - `<strong>`: Indicates **strong importance**.
  - `<em>`: Indicates **emphasis**.
  - ✅ These are better for **accessibility** and **SEO**.

## 13. How to handle events in HTML?

In HTML, **events** are actions that occur in the browser, such as clicks, key presses, page loads, etc. You can handle these events using **event attributes** directly in HTML elements.

### Common Event Attributes:

- `onclick`: Triggered when an element is clicked.
- `onmouseover`: Triggered when the mouse hovers over an element.
- `onchange`: Triggered when the value of an input element changes.
- `onload`: Triggered when the page finishes loading.

### Example:

```html
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
```

## 14. What is new about the relationship between the `<header>` and `<h1>` tags in HTML5?

In **HTML5**, the `<header>` tag is a new semantic element that represents the **introductory content** or a **section heading** for a page or part of a page.

What’s new is that you can now use **multiple `<header>` tags** throughout the page, and each can contain its own `<h1>` tag.

### Key Points:

- In **HTML4**, only one `<h1>` per page was recommended for structure and accessibility.
- In **HTML5**, multiple `<h1>` tags are valid when scoped within separate `<header>` elements inside different sections or articles.

### Example:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Main Site Title</h1>
</header>

<section>
  <header>
    <h1>Article Title</h1>
  </header>
</section>
```

## 15. What is the difference between `<figure>` tag and `<img>` tag?

The `<img>` and `<figure>` tags serve different purposes in HTML5.

### `<img>` Tag:

- Used to **embed an image** into a web page.
- It’s a **self-closing** tag.
- Contains attributes like `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height`.

### `<figure>` Tag:

- Introduced in **HTML5** as a **semantic container** for self-contained content like images, diagrams, illustrations, or code snippets.
- Typically used **with `<figcaption>`** to add a caption or description to the content.
- Helps with **semantic meaning**, accessibility, and SEO.

### Example:

```html
<figure>
  <img src="mountain.jpg" alt="Snowy mountain" />
  <figcaption>Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## 16. Are the `<datalist>` tag and `<select>` tag the same?

No, the `<datalist>` and `<select>` tags are **not the same**, although both provide a list of options to the user.

### `<select>` Tag:

- Creates a **dropdown menu** with predefined options.
- The user can only choose from the listed options.
- Example:

```html
<select>
  <option value="HTML">HTML</option>
  <option value="CSS">CSS</option>
</select>
```
