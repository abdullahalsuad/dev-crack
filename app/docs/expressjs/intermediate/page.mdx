## 1. What is express.static()?

`express.static()` is a built-in Express middleware that serves static files (like HTML, CSS, images, or JavaScript) from a specified folder. When a client requests a file, Express automatically sends it without needing a custom route.

**Why use it?**

- Simplifies serving assets like stylesheets, scripts, or images for your web app.
- No need to write routes for each file.

üì¶ **Example:**

1. Create a folder named `public` in your project with an `index.html` file:

```html
<!-- public/index.html -->
<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
```

2. Set up your Express app:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Serve static files from the 'public' folder
app.use(express.static("public"));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

‚öôÔ∏è **How it works:**

- Visiting http://localhost:3000/index.html serves the `index.html` file from the `public` folder.
- If you add `public/styles.css`, it‚Äôs available at http://localhost:3000/styles.css.
- The `public` folder acts like the root directory for static files.

## 2. How do you handle errors in Express?

Express allows you to handle errors using special error-handling middleware. This middleware has four parameters (`err`, `req`, `res`, `next`) and is called when an error occurs in your app. You can use it to send custom error messages or log errors.

üîπ **Steps:**

- Define error-handling middleware at the end of your middleware stack.
- Use `next(err)` in routes to pass errors to this middleware.
- Send a response with an error message and status code.

üì¶ **Example:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
  } catch (err) {
    next(err); // Pass error to error-handling middleware
  }
});

// Error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.message); // Log the error
  res.status(500).send("Oops, something broke!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

‚öôÔ∏è **How it works:**

The `/` route throws an error, which is passed to the error-handling middleware via `next(err)`.
The middleware catches the error, logs it, and sends a 500 status with a message.
Visiting http://localhost:3000 shows: `Oops, something broke!`.

## 3. What is the difference between `app.get()` and `app.use()`?

In Express, `app.get()` and `app.use()` serve different purposes:

`app.get(path, callback)`
Defines a route handler for **GET requests** to a specific URL path. It‚Äôs used to send responses for specific routes and HTTP methods.

`app.use([path], callback)`
Applies middleware or route handlers to **all HTTP methods** (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) for a given path (or **all paths** if no path is specified). It‚Äôs commonly used for middleware.

**Key Differences:**

- `app.get()` is **specific to GET requests**; `app.use()` applies to **all HTTP methods**.
- `app.get()` is typically used for **routes**; `app.use()` is used for **middleware** or general-purpose handlers.
- `app.use()` can take an **optional path**, while `app.get()` **always requires a path**.

---

üì¶ **Example:**

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Middleware with app.use
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("This runs for ALL requests");
  next();
});

// Route with app.get
app.get("/home", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to the home page!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

‚öôÔ∏è **How it works:**

- The `app.use` middleware logs a message for all requests, regardless of the URL or method.
- The `app.get` route only responds to GET requests to /home.
- Visiting http://localhost:3000/home logs the middleware message and shows: `Welcome to the home page!`.

## 4. How do you serve HTML files in Express?

To serve HTML files in Express, you use `res.sendFile()` to send a specific file to the client. The path module is often used to create absolute file paths to avoid errors across different operating systems.

üîπ **Steps:**

1. Create an HTML file in your project (e.g., `public/index.html`).
2. Use `res.sendFile()` with the absolute path to the file.
3. Optionally, use `express.static()` to serve the entire folder containing the HTML file.

üì¶ **Example:**

- Create public/index.html:

```html
<h1>My Express Website</h1>
<p>Welcome to my page!</p>
```

- Set up your Express app: javascript

```js
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.sendFile(path.join(\_\_dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

‚öôÔ∏è **How it works:**

- `path.join(\_\_dirname, 'public', 'index.html')` creates the absolute path to index.html.
- Visiting http://localhost:3000 displays the HTML
- content: My Express Website and Welcome to my page!.

---

## 5. What is the purpose of `next()` in middleware?

In Express middleware, `next()` is a function that passes control to the next middleware or route handler in the chain. If you don‚Äôt call `next()`, the request will hang, and the client won‚Äôt receive a response.

**Why is it needed?**

Middleware often performs tasks (e.g., logging, authentication) and then hands off the request to the next handler.
`next()` ensures the request continues processing.

üì¶ **Example:**

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Middleware 1
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Middleware 1: Logging request");
  next(); // Move to the next middleware
});

// Middleware 2
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Middleware 2: Adding timestamp");
  req.timestamp = new Date();
  next(); // Move to the route
});

// Route
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Request processed at: ${req.timestamp}`);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

‚öôÔ∏è **How it works:**

- Middleware 1 logs a message and calls `next()` to pass control.
- Middleware 2 adds a timestamp to req and calls `next()`.
- The route uses the timestamp and sends a response.
- Visiting http://localhost:3000 shows something like: `Request processed at: 2025-07-28T16:34:00.000Z`.

## 6. How do you handle 404 errors in Express?

A 404 error occurs when a client requests a route that doesn‚Äôt exist. In Express, you handle 404 errors by adding a middleware function at the end of your middleware and route stack. This middleware catches any unmatched requests and sends a 404 response.

üîπ **Steps:**

1. Place the 404 middleware after all routes.
2. Use `res.status(404)` to set the HTTP status and send a response.

üì¶ **Example:**

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Home page");
});

// 404 middleware (must be last)
app.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).send("Page not found!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

‚öôÔ∏è **How it works:**

- Visiting http://localhost:3000/ shows: Home page.
- Visiting http://localhost:3000/random (an undefined route) shows: Page not found! with a 404 status code.

## 7. What is Express Router?

Express Router is a feature in Express.js that lets you group related routes and middleware into a separate, reusable module. It‚Äôs like a mini Express app that handles specific routes, making your code more organized and easier to maintain, especially for large apps.

**Why use it?**

- Keeps your main app.js file clean by moving routes to separate files.
- Makes routes reusable across different parts of your app.
- Simplifies managing related routes (e.g., all user-related routes in one place).

üì¶ **Example:**

- Create a file named userRoutes.js:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("List of users");
});

router.get("/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User with ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});

module.exports = router;
```

- Use it in app.js:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const userRoutes = require("./userRoutes");
app.use("/users", userRoutes);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

‚öôÔ∏è **How it works:**

- `express.Router()` creates a router instance.
- Routes defined in userRoutes.js handle requests to /users (e.g., http://localhost:3000/users shows "List of users").
- /users/:id handles requests like http://localhost:3000/users/123, showing "User with ID: 123".

---

## 8. How do you use Express Router?

Using Express Router involves creating a router instance, defining routes on it, and then mounting it on your Express app with `app.use()`. This lets you organize routes into separate files and attach them to specific paths.

üîπ **Steps:**

1. Create a router in a separate file (e.g., routes/users.js).
2. Define routes using `router.get()`, `router.post()`, etc.
   Export the router and use it in your main app with `app.use()`.

üì¶ **Example:**

- Create routes/users.js:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("All users");
});

router.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User profile page");
});

module.exports = router;
```

- Use it in app.js:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const userRoutes = require("./routes/users");
app.use("/users", userRoutes);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

‚öôÔ∏è **How it works:**

- Visiting http://localhost:3000/users shows "All users".
- Visiting http://localhost:3000/users/profile shows "User profile page".
- `app.use('/users', userRoutes)` mounts the router so all its routes start with /users.
