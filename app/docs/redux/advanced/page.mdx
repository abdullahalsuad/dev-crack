### **1. What are Redux Middlewares and how do they work?**

**Explanation:**
Middlewares in Redux intercept actions before they reach the reducer. They allow for logging, async operations, error handling, etc. Middleware functions have access to `dispatch` and `getState`, and they can modify or delay actions.

**Example:**

```js
const logger = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  console.log("Dispatching:", action);
  return next(action);
};
```

### **2. What is the purpose of Redux Thunk?**

**Explanation:**
Redux Thunk allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This function can dispatch multiple actions and access the state asynchronously — useful for API calls or delayed logic.

**Example:**

```js
const fetchUsers = () => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/users");
    const data = await res.json();
    dispatch({ type: "SET_USERS", payload: data });
  };
};
```

### **3. How does Redux Toolkit simplify Redux development?**

**Explanation:**
Redux Toolkit (RTK) abstracts away boilerplate code, provides built-in `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`, and immutability with Immer. It enforces best practices and makes Redux easier and more readable.

**Example:**

```js
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: 0,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => state + 1,
  },
});
```

### **4. How does Immer work in Redux Toolkit?**

**Explanation:**
Immer lets you write "mutating" logic in reducers, but under the hood it keeps the state immutable by tracking changes and returning a new object. RTK uses Immer by default inside `createSlice`.

**Example:**

```js
reducers: {
  increment: (state) => {
    state.count += 1; // Looks like mutation, but it's safe!
  };
}
```

### **5. What is createAsyncThunk in Redux Toolkit?**

**Explanation:**
`createAsyncThunk` is used to handle async logic like API calls. It auto-generates action types for pending, fulfilled, and rejected states, helping you manage loading, success, and error cases easily.

**Example:**

```js
export const fetchPosts = createAsyncThunk("posts/fetch", async () => {
  const res = await fetch("/api/posts");
  return await res.json();
});
```

### **6. What are selectors in Redux and why use reselect?**

**Explanation:**
Selectors are functions that retrieve specific parts of the state. Reselect is a library to create memoized selectors — it avoids recomputing derived data unless input state changes, improving performance.

**Example:**

```js
const selectPosts = (state) => state.posts;
const selectPublished = createSelector([selectPosts], (posts) =>
  posts.filter((p) => p.published)
);
```

### **7. Explain the Redux DevTools Extension.**

**Explanation:**
Redux DevTools let you inspect actions, state changes, and time-travel debug your Redux app. You connect it via middleware or with Redux Toolkit’s `configureStore` which supports it out of the box.

**Example:**

```js
const store = configureStore({ reducer: rootReducer });
```

---

### **8. What is the difference between Redux and Context API?**

**Explanation:**
Context API is simpler and good for low-frequency updates and static global state. Redux is better for complex apps with frequent state changes, time-travel debugging, and middleware support.

**Example:**
Use Redux for apps with async API calls and dev tooling needs; use Context for theme or auth status.

---

### **9. How do you persist Redux state?**

**Explanation:**
You can persist Redux state using libraries like `redux-persist`, which stores parts of your state in `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, etc., and rehydrates them on app reload.

**Example:**

```js
import { persistStore, persistReducer } from "redux-persist";
```

---

### **10. How do you handle side effects in Redux besides Thunk?**

**Explanation:**
Other side-effect libraries include `redux-saga` and `redux-observable`. `redux-saga` uses generator functions for more complex async flows, making it easy to cancel, debounce, and coordinate actions.

**Example (redux-saga):**

```js
function* fetchUser() {
  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser);
  yield put({ type: "USER_RECEIVED", user });
}
```
