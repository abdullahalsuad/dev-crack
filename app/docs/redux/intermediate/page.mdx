### 1. **What is Redux Thunk?**

**Explanation:**
Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to **write functions inside action creators** to handle asynchronous logic (like API calls). Normally, Redux only allows synchronous actions (plain objects). Thunk lets you delay the dispatch of an action or dispatch only if a certain condition is met.

**Example:**

```js
// Action Creator using Redux Thunk
const fetchUser = () => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: "USER_LOADING" });
    const res = await fetch("/api/user");
    const data = await res.json();
    dispatch({ type: "USER_SUCCESS", payload: data });
  };
};
```

### 2. **What are the benefits of using Redux?**

**Explanation:**

- **Centralized State:** All app state lives in one place, making debugging easier.
- **Predictability:** State changes are predictable due to pure reducer functions.
- **Middleware Support:** You can extend Redux with logging, crash reporting, async APIs, etc.

**Example Use:** In a large app like an LMS or eCommerce site, Redux helps manage state across login, cart, products, and user data in a centralized way.

### 3. **How is Redux different from Context API?**

**Explanation:**

- **Context API** is good for light state like theme or language.
- **Redux** is designed for **complex state logic**, **data flows**, and **middleware**.
- Redux offers **time-travel debugging, dev tools, and better performance** in deep component trees.

**Example:**
For a theme toggle, use Context API.
For a blog app with posts, comments, likes, and user rolesâ€”Redux is better.

### 4. **What are action creators?**

**Explanation:**
Action creators are functions that return action objects. They make your code cleaner and reusable. Instead of hardcoding action objects everywhere, wrap them in functions.

**Example:**

```js
// Without action creator
dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });

// With action creator
const increment = () => ({ type: "INCREMENT" });
dispatch(increment());
```

### 5. **What is the role of `Provider` in Redux?**

**Explanation:**
The `Provider` component is used to **pass the Redux store to all child components**. Without it, components cannot access the Redux store using hooks like `useSelector` or `useDispatch`.

**Example:**

```jsx
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store";

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>;
```

---

### 6. **What are `useSelector` and `useDispatch`?**

**Explanation:**

- `useSelector()` lets you **read a specific piece of state** from the Redux store.
- `useDispatch()` returns the **dispatch function** so you can send actions to the reducer.

**Example:**

```js
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";

const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

<button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>+</button>;
```

### 7. **How do you structure a Redux project?**

**Explanation:**
A clean project structure helps maintain large-scale apps. You separate concerns like actions, reducers, and API calls.

**Example Directory Structure:**

```
/src
  /redux
    - actions/
    - reducers/
    - store.js
    - types.js
```

Each feature (like auth, user, post) can have its own sub-folder for scalability.

---

### 8. **What is Redux DevTools Extension?**

**Explanation:**
Redux DevTools lets you **see each dispatched action**, **current state**, and even **time-travel** between state changes. It's helpful for debugging and development.

**Example Integration:**

```js
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
);
```

You can then view Redux actions in your browser extension.

### 9. **How do you handle async API calls in Redux?**

**Explanation:**
To handle async calls, you use middleware like `redux-thunk`. This allows dispatching an action **after an async call finishes**.

**Example:**

```js
const fetchTodos = () => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: "TODOS_LOADING" });
    const response = await fetch("/api/todos");
    const todos = await response.json();
    dispatch({ type: "TODOS_SUCCESS", payload: todos });
  };
};
```

---

### 10. **What are selectors in Redux?**

**Explanation:**
Selectors are **functions used to get specific slices of the state**. They make your components cleaner and support memoization (performance boost).

**Example:**

```js
// Selector
const selectActiveUsers = (state) => state.users.filter((user) => user.active);

// Usage
const activeUsers = useSelector(selectActiveUsers);
```

You can also use libraries like `reselect` for memoized selectors.
