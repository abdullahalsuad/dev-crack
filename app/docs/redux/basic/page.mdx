## 1. What is Redux?

**Answer:** Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript apps, commonly used with React.
It stores the entire application state in a single JavaScript object called the **store**.
Components read from the store and dispatch actions to update it.

## 2. What are the core principles of Redux?

**Answer:**

1. **Single Source of Truth:** State is stored in a single object.
2. **State is Read-Only:** You can’t directly modify state—only through actions.
3. **Pure Functions:** Reducers are pure functions that return new state based on action.

## 3. What is a store in Redux?

**Answer:**
The **store** holds the entire app state and provides methods to access (`getState()`), update (`dispatch()`), and listen (`subscribe()`) to state changes.

```js
import { createStore } from "redux";
const store = createStore(reducer);
```

---

## 4. What is an action in Redux?

**Answer:**
An **action** is a plain JS object that has a `type` field and optionally a `payload`.
It describes **what happened**, not how the state should change.

```js
{ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 }
```

## 5. What is a reducer?

**Answer:**
A reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, then returns the new state.
It must be **pure** (no side effects).

```js
function counter(state = 0, action) {
  if (action.type === "INCREMENT") return state + 1;
  return state;
}
```

## 6. How do you update state in Redux?

**Answer:**
By **dispatching an action** to the store. The reducer handles the action and returns a new state.

```js
store.dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });
```

---

## 7. What is `combineReducers`?

**Answer:**
Redux allows splitting reducers into smaller functions and combining them with `combineReducers`.
Each reducer manages its own slice of state.

```js
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
const rootReducer = combineReducers({ auth: authReducer, user: userReducer });
```

---

## 8. What is `dispatch()` in Redux?

**Answer:**
`dispatch()` sends an action to the reducer to update the state.
It’s the only way to trigger a state change in Redux.

```js
store.dispatch({ type: "LOGIN_SUCCESS" });
```

---

## 9. How do you access state in Redux?

**Answer:**
Use `store.getState()` or in React use `useSelector()` hook.

```js
const counter = useSelector((state) => state.counter);
```

## 10. What is middleware in Redux?

**Answer:**
Middleware intercepts dispatched actions before they reach reducers.
Useful for logging, async operations, or modifying actions.
Example: `redux-thunk`, `redux-logger`.
