### **01. What is React?**

**React** is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building **user interfaces**, especially for **single-page applications (SPAs)**. Developed by Facebook, React lets you build UI components that manage their own state and can be composed to make complex UIs.

Unlike traditional JS apps where you manipulate the DOM directly using `document.querySelector`, React maintains a **virtual DOM**, which is a copy of the real DOM kept in memory. React uses this to efficiently update only parts of the page that need to change, making it **fast and scalable**.

> 🔧 Think of React as LEGO blocks — each block (component) can be reused and rearranged without changing the entire structure.

```jsx
function ProfileCard() {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <img src="/avatar.jpg" alt="Profile" />
      <h2>KAWSAR KABIR</h2>
      <p>Frontend Developer</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This UI piece can now be reused across your app — on home, profile, team page, etc.

---

### **02. What is JSX in React?**

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a **syntax extension** that allows writing HTML elements directly within JavaScript code. It's not valid JavaScript by default, so **Babel** (a compiler) is used to convert JSX into regular JavaScript calls like `React.createElement()`.

JSX lets you embed expressions (`{}`), conditionals (ternary, `&&`), and map over arrays to create elements dynamically. This makes JSX incredibly powerful for building UI based on logic or data.

> 🧠 JSX is not a string, and it's not HTML. It's syntactic sugar that makes your code cleaner.

```jsx
const user = {
  name: "Kawsar",
  isLoggedIn: true,
};

const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome, {user.name}</h1>
    {user.isLoggedIn ? <p>You are logged in</p> : <p>Please log in</p>}
  </div>
);
```

Behind the scenes, this turns into nested `React.createElement()` calls.

---

### **03. What are components in React?**

Components are **independent, reusable pieces of UI**. They can be small, like a button, or large, like a sidebar or full page. In React, you break the UI into components to make your code **modular, testable, and reusable**.

There are two main types:

- **Functional Components** (modern and hook-based)
- **Class Components** (older, rarely used in new apps)

Components can accept **props** and manage **state** internally. They can even be nested within each other, allowing powerful UI composition.

> 🧱 Think of components as mini-templates that you can reuse with different data.

```jsx
function ProductCard({ name, price }) {
  return (
    <div className="product">
      <h3>{name}</h3>
      <p>Price: ${price}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <ProductCard name="Headphones" price={49} />
      <ProductCard name="Keyboard" price={99} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Each `ProductCard` is the same component reused with different props.

---

### **04. What is state in React?**

**State** is a built-in object that stores **dynamic data** in a component and allows the component to react (re-render) when that data changes. State should be used for **interactive** or **changing parts** of your component like toggles, inputs, counters, etc.

In functional components, you use the `useState` hook to define state. You must **never mutate state directly**; always use the setter function to trigger a re-render.

> 🔁 React state is like a memory bank for your component. When you update it, the component redraws itself to match.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increase = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={increase}>+ Increase</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Each click updates the `count` state and triggers a UI re-render.

---

### **05. What are props in React?**

**Props** (short for “properties”) are how components **receive data** from their parent components. They are **read-only**, meaning a child cannot modify them. Props help in **passing dynamic values** to reusable components and in creating more flexible UIs.

Props can be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, or even functions.

> 📦 Props are like function arguments: You pass them into a component to customize what it does or displays.

```jsx
function WelcomeMessage({ username }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {username}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <WelcomeMessage username="Kawsar" />
      <WelcomeMessage username="Maruf" />
    </>
  );
}
```

This reuses `WelcomeMessage` to greet different users using different props.

---

### **06. What is the difference between state and props in React?**

Both **state** and **props** are used to manage data in React, but they serve different purposes:

| Feature    | Props                  | State                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Mutability | Immutable (read-only)  | Mutable (can be updated)         |
| Scope      | Passed from parent     | Managed within component         |
| Use case   | Customizing components | Managing local, interactive data |

- **Props** come from a parent component and help **configure a child**.
- **State** is internal and controls how a component behaves over time.

> 🔄 State is like the mood of a person, while props are like the clothes they’re wearing — others see it, but can’t change it.

```jsx
function Counter({ step }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + step)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return <Counter step={5} />; // passing props
}
```

- `step` is a prop (immutable, from parent).
- `count` is state (mutable, changes inside component).

---

### **07. What is a React hook?**

Hooks are **functions** introduced in React 16.8 that let you “hook into” React features like **state**, **lifecycle**, and **context** from **functional components**.

Before hooks, only class components had state and lifecycle. Hooks changed that, making **functional components** just as powerful — and even more concise.

> 🔧 Hooks are tools like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc., that help you manage component logic in a clean, modular way.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Clock() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date());

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => setTime(new Date()), 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(timer); // cleanup
  }, []);

  return <h2>{time.toLocaleTimeString()}</h2>;
}
```

This shows the real-time clock using `useState` and `useEffect`.

---

### **08. What is useEffect and when to use it?**

`useEffect` is a React hook that lets you **run side effects** in your component — like data fetching, setting up subscriptions, DOM updates, or timers.

It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` from class components.

You can control when the effect runs by passing a **dependency array**.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted");

  return () => {
    console.log("Component unmounted");
  };
}, []); // only on mount/unmount
```

> 📦 `useEffect` is like a delivery worker — it shows up after render and can leave behind cleanup when it's done.

More real-world example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/api/data")
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => setData(data));
}, []);
```

This runs **once**, like `componentDidMount`.

---

### **09. What is conditional rendering in React?**

**Conditional rendering** means showing or hiding parts of the UI based on a condition. In React, this is done using `if`, `ternary ( ? : )`, `&&`, or early `return`.

It helps create **dynamic interfaces**, like showing login forms only if the user isn’t logged in.

```jsx
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  if (!user) {
    return <p>Please log in.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Welcome, {user.name}</h2>
      <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here we check for a user before rendering their profile. This prevents errors like accessing `user.name` when `user` is `null`.

---

### **10. What are keys in React and why are they important?**

**Keys** help React **identify which items changed, added, or removed** from a list. They're critical when rendering dynamic lists — without them, React may re-render inefficiently or wrongly reuse elements.

> 🧠 Keys help React maintain stability across renders, avoiding bugs like input field focus loss or animations breaking.

```jsx
const products = [
  { id: 1, name: "Book" },
  { id: 2, name: "Pen" },
];

return (
  <ul>
    {products.map((product) => (
      <li key={product.id}>{product.name}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

💥 **Common mistake:**
Using the index as key (`key={index}`) is only okay **if the list never changes**. Otherwise, it causes **weird re-renders**.
