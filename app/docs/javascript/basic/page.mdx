## 1. What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?

- `var` is function-scoped and can be re-declared.
- `let` is block-scoped and cannot be re-declared.
- `const` is also block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.

```js
function example() {
  var a = 1;
  let b = 2;
  const c = 3;

  if (true) {
    var a = 10; // allowed
    let b = 20; // different scope
    // const c = 30; // different scope
  }

  console.log(a); // 10
  console.log(b); // 2
  console.log(c); // 3
}
```

## 2. What is a closure?

A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

## 3. What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Hoisting is JavaScriptâ€™s behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;
```

`var` declarations are hoisted with value `undefined`. `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized.

## 4. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

- `==` compares values after type conversion.
- `===` compares both value and type.

```js
console.log(2 == "2"); // true
console.log(2 === "2"); // false
```

---

## 5. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?

- **Synchronous** code runs line-by-line.
- **Asynchronous** code allows non-blocking operations like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, etc.

```js
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Async"), 1000);
console.log("End");
```

Output:

```
Start
End
Async
```

## 6. What are arrow functions and how are they different from regular functions?

Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions and **do not have their own `this`**.

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

Arrow functions are best used for simple tasks or inside array methods.

---

## 7. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

- `undefined`: a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- `null`: an assignment value that represents no value.

```js
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

let b = null;
console.log(b); // null
```

---

## 8. What is event delegation?

Event delegation is a technique of handling events at a **parent element** instead of the children.

```js
document.getElementById("list").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log("Clicked:", e.target.textContent);
  }
});
```

---

## 9. What is the use of `this` keyword?

`this` refers to the object that is executing the current function.

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello", this.name);
  },
};

person.greet(); // Hello John
```

---

## 10. What is a promise?

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Success"), 1000);
});

promise.then((res) => console.log(res)); // Success
```
